# Prerequisites
## Anaconda Installation
- Download from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
- Follow the steps mentioned in [Anaconda document](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) to install Anaconda on your desktop/laptop.
## IBMQ account preparation
- Register an account: https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/
- Get an API key from https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/account. 
  - Search for the string `API token`. 
  - Save the token string in a file called `ibmq_api_key.txt` and put this file in the upper folder `quantum-computing-practice/` (Don't put this file in ch7).  
# Execute Jupyter notebook files 
## Launch Anaconda Jupyter notebook
- Lanuch `Anaconda Navigator` (Mac OS) -> Choose `Jupter notebook`
## Package installation
- Execute `0.package_installation.ipynb` wtih Jupyter notebook.
## IBMQ account logon
- Execute `1.login_ibmq_account.ipynb` with Jupyter notebook.
## Practices
- Feel free to open the rest of files with Jupyter notebook and execute it.
## P.S
- `0.package_installation.ipynb`: only need to be installed _ONCE_ after Anaconda installation. (只要在Anaconda安裝完執行一次就可以)
- `1.login_ibmq_account.ipynb`: ensure you need to execute this file _ONCE_ before starting to practicing the files in this folder. (只要開始練習前執行一次就可以)
